# Built-By:
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* express.js
* npm (dotenv)
* Path 
* React.js
* Material UI
* MongoDB (Mongoose)
* Axio (Restful APIs)
* Nodemon & concurrently & react router dom

## Built-Logic:
1. Write out DB Models
2. Work on the CRUD api calls at the backend controller files and test them in Insomnia.
3. Once routes on backend are tested, go to frontend JS files (react) and connect the APIs from backend to the frontend elements using react states and conditional rendering.
4. Styling (CSS & Material UI).
